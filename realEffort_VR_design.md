## Real effort task

Subjects add up sets of five two-digit numbers. 

No calc, only pen and paper. 

Numbers are randomly drawn. 

Once the participant submits an answer on the computer, a new problem appears jointly with information on whether the former answer was correct.

The final score is determined by the number of correctly solved problems.
